It's easier than you think and there are plenty of ways to make sure your THC infused chicken is safe and delicious.\r\n\r\nThe first step in making weed chicken is infusing the honey or hash oil with THC.

        "description": "Cannabis butter, also referred to as cannabutter, is a commonly used ingredient in recipes for cannabis-infused food. It is made by simmering cannabis flower, trim or CBD oil of your choice in butter or another fat, such as coconut oil or olive oil, for several hours. The cannabinoids in the cannabis, such as THC and CBD, are then infused into the butter, creating a potent ingredient that can be used in a variety of recipes. Cannabis butter is often used in baking, such as in cookies, brownies, and cakes, but can also be used to create savory dishes like pasta sauces or mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that the potency of cannabis butter can vary greatly depending on the strain and amount used, so it is important to use caution when consuming edibles made with cannabutter.",
