The "Better Call Bob!" web app is a recipe platform that allows users to explore and interact with a collection of cannabis-related recipes. Users can browse recipes, view recipe details, and filter recipes based on different categories and criteria.

Index Page (HTML & CSS):

The index page of the web app serves as the main landing page. It includes a header with buttons representing various recipe categories ("Cocktails," "Basics," etc.). The page has a dynamic background image and displays six randomly selected recipes at a time. Each recipe card contains an image and title. Users can click on an image to view the detailed recipe page.

Index Page JavaScript:

The JavaScript code for the index page manages the functionality of displaying random recipes, filtering recipes by category, and opening external links when users click on "About us" or "Contact your local dealer."

Recipe Detail Page (HTML & CSS):

This page displays detailed information about a selected recipe. It shows the recipe title, description, rating, image, list of ingredients, and preparation instructions. Users can also click a button to buy ingredients for the recipe. A "Return" button is provided to navigate back to the index page.

Recipe Detail Page JavaScript:

The JavaScript code for the recipe detail page retrieves the specific recipe's details based on the recipe ID passed as a query parameter. It populates the page with the recipe's information, including the title, description, rating, image, ingredients, and instructions. It also handles the "Return" button to navigate back to the index page.

Overall, the web app creates an interactive platform where users can explore a variety of cannabis recipes, view their details, and engage with the content through dynamic filtering and navigation features.
